#INFO
To use the templates, you need warmup.  
To get from source, take a look at http://github.com/chucknorris/warmup  
To get the gem, please run 'gem install warmup'.  

Once you have that, you need to point it to one of the templates.  
To point to this repository, your config (ruby location is something like the following: C:\Ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\warmup-0.0.0.23.20110116\bin) should look like this:  
'<warmup sourceControlType="git"  
         sourceControlWarmupLocation="git://github.com/ferventcoder/warmup-templates.git">'  
  
Happy coding!
